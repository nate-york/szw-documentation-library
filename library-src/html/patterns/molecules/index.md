title: Molecules
description: In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result. In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a "do one thing and do it well" mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.
