## NewGen Updates
The international NewGen site is a static site; however, the domestic site is different and has been updated. 

If you are given a task to update NewGen this is likely to be an edit for the international NewGen site. Because it is statically generated, you'll need to right click on the NewGen project (SubZero.NewGen) and select 'Set as StartUp Project' and then click ctrl + f5 to view the NewGen site locally. To view the international site locally add '/international' to the end of the url that is produced after click ctrl+f5. The live site for the NewGen international site is: http://newgeneration.subzero-wolf.com/international.
