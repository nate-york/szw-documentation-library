To access Sitecore style sheets go to --> sitecore > All Applications > File Explorer > sitecore > Shell > Themes > Standard > Default

If you need to make style changes to the Sitecore CMS styling, it'll most likely be the default.css file in the "Default" folder. Make sure that you're editing the default.css file in the "Default" folder as there is another default.css file in the "Standard" folder, which is not the same file.
