This documentation library exists outside of Sitecore as an independent piece to the site. It contains multiple libraries of information, ranging from environment setups, development knowledgebases, Front End Patterns, and Content Management instructions. 

The library uses the main site's style file, so any changes to styles in here would cause a global change.

## History 
This library started as the Pattern Library only, and eventually expanded into what it is today. The library has always been hosted outside of the Sitecore environment and treated like its own project. It started as a bunch of .aspx files, and became the Node based version later on to help aide with templating and sustainability.
