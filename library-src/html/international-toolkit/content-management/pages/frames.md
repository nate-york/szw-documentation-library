Dynamic renderings are predefined layouts that allow content editors to craft custom content within pages of the website, which are commonly referred to as Frames, Framesets, or Frameset Groups (for more information on the difference between each one, [click here](/library/international-toolkit/onboarding/website-terminology/#frames)

In Sitecore, navigate to Content > Global > Site Configuration > Dynamic Renderings > Frames (or Framesets or Frameset Groups).
