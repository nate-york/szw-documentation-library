Sub-Zero and Wolf are adding new products to their offering throughout the year, so we want to ensure the right products are available to you as they roll out.  As products become available, Sub-Zero and Wolf will add them and all necessary imagery, videos and product data to the CMS and notify you via Basecamp where to find the information. Then, we will work with you to ensure the content is correct, and verify the timing for when it should appear on your Distributor website. 

**Do you have a product in your region that is not appearing on your website or changes to a product that is appearing?** Add a “To Do” in Basecamp with the name of the product, assign it to Todd Wengel, and he will address it.
