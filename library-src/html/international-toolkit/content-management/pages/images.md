## Hero Images

### Sizing and Cropping Hero
Hero images are cropped and resized using [ImageResizer](http://imageresizing.net/docs/v4/reference). While the goal is to be able to use any image without having to provide a specific crop, there are minimum requirements for both height and width of an image. 

The goal is to end up with a cropped image at the dimensions 1900px x 855px. Each image intended to be used needs to be at least 1900px wide, and at least 855px tall. 

If an image does not meet one or both of the requirements, the resulting cropped image will be limited in either width or height equal to the original image width or height. 

For example, If an image is 1367px wide, the cropped image will only be able to have a max width of 1367px. Imageresizer will not upscale images due to quality loss. 

Please refer to the examples below.

### Scaling of Hero Images
Hero images scale to use 100% of page width, while keeping the scale of the cropped images. In this example, the incorrectly scaled image will appear taller on the page than the standard image size.
